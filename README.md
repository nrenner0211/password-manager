## Idea Dump

We are going for the MVP (just make it work), but if we have time to make our app better, we can add ideas here!

- come up with a catchy name, SecuriT, SecuriSave? etc

- one of our requirements is to use a new technology, so maybe we can find a new hasher or other encryption technology

- if we have time, implementing light/dark mode would give us points for interactivity

- generate random password (maybe we can use code from our password-generator)

- other security apps have features such as add secure notes, add debit card, upload docs, weak password alert
