# Vault

## About

Vault is an application that acts as a secure password manager. In the age of big data leaks, we want to produce a safe place for your information. User story below:

`AS A person concerned with privacy on the internet`

`I WANT a secure application to save sensitive items`

`SO THAT I can have safe storage and peace of mind`

## Project Requirements

`Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API`

`Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine`

`Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database`

`Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data`

`Be deployed using Heroku (with data)`

`Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed`

`Have a polished UI`

`Be responsive`

`Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)`

`Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm`

`Include authentication (express-session and cookies)`

`Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables`

`Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)`

`Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)`

## Future Development

In the future, we would like to add features such as light/dark mode, weak password alert, add secure notes, generate random password, and a file portal to act as a virtual filing cabinet.
